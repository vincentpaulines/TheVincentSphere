					<p> Hello! My name is Vincent and am currently studying engineering. Initially this was meant as a personal portfolio (You may see my resume and a catalog of projects I have worked on down below). However, I also wanted a place to assort whatever ideas, questions, jokes, and thought experiments that come up in my head. </p>
					<p>
					I plan to slowly add updates to this overtime (numbered pages, comments/replies not being able to send images without text (please help), nicer visuals, etc.) though bear with me, web development is not my forte. </p>
					<p> If you wish to contact me, my email is vincentpaulines@gmail.com. </p>
